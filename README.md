Welcome!  
This Unity project is an attempt to create a simple yet well-designed stealth game prototype in just 5 days.  
In the 12 weeks following this prototype, I will be working alongside members of my Team Software Engineering team to design a stealth game incorporating the theme of "non-verbal communication".  
However, in a previous module, Concept Development, we (a separate team) encountered issues due to a lack of a well designed project structure. To mitigate these risks ahead of this next project, this short project will help me familiarise myself with properly structuring a Unity project and any issues associated with the process.  
In particular, I would like to apply newfound knowledge of:
1. SOLID principles
2. Scriptable objects
3. Unit testing in Unity
4. Proper namespacing

This README will be updated after each day so you can follow development!
